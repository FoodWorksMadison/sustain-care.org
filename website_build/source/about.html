                    also supporting restaurants, food-service workers and farmers.

        <h3>We aim to connect community care initiatives to individuals who can donate or otherwise help.</h3>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> As COVID-19 continues to impact our community now and in the future, a number of individual and group initiatives have been created to support workers and their families. We want to help you to find out “who is doing what”.</p>
        <p><strong>How:</strong> By building a central directory we are aiming to be a force multiplier to:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>list initiatives in one easy-to-navigate place</li>
        <li>help people and groups in need of meals connect with those initiatives</li>
        <li>provide a simple way for you — members of our community — to step up to support your neighbors, and provide meals for them and their families</li>
        </ol>

        <h1 id="goals" class="title">Our Ultimate Goals</h1>

        <h3>1. Help essential workers and their families by delivering as many prepared meals as possible.</h3>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> Workers are being asked to work longer hours. And they still have basic needs, like feeding themselves and their families. Many of our neighbors have lost their jobs and require a little extra help right now.</p>
        <p><strong>How:</strong> Our community can step up to support workers’ basic needs, like feeding themselves and their families, and do so in a way that keeps the cost of meals to essential workers low, simplifies menus, and allows meals to be prepared and delivered in bulk.</p>

        <h3>2. Preserve systems:</h3>
        <p><strong>… by helping to re-create and build demand in the restaurant, distribution, and small farm economy while feeding essential workers high quality meals that are prepared by well-paid kitchen staff under safe working conditions.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> We live in an interconnected community. By providing meals to workers and their families we can not only address a basic need during a stressful time, we can also get restaurant staff back to work at a living wage and under safe working conditions, as well as increase demand for local farmers.</p>
        <p><strong>How:</strong> The decrease in demand for restaurant dine-in meals due to Wisconsin’s “safer at home” order, can be partially offset by increased demand for “delivery meals”. And this can be done while promoting food worker livelihood and safety as well as keeping the quality of the menus and meals high so that they are a morale boost for essential workers and a compelling proposition for meal donors.</p>

        <h3>3. Address existing exacerbated systemic disparities</h3>
        <p><strong>… by identifying people in need of high quality food, and connecting producers and distribution systems to get this food to them and their families.</strong> And recruiting funders, farmers and other suppliers, food producers, and delivery systems and getting high quality meals to where they are most needed, and doing so in a way that respects and advances a safe, just, and robust labor-friendly economy from farm to table.</p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> COVID-19 will continue to highlight and amplify the many inequities facing our community. Essential workers are most visible in their need right now, and as the ramifications of COVID continue to be felt that need will grow to the unemployed and their families.</p>
        <p><strong>How:</strong> We aim to create a model that supplements existing systems to address the highest needs and do so safely and justly and in a sustainable way as the effects of the pandemic continue to be felt across our community.</p>

        <h3>4. Prepare for a coming hunger crisis</h3>
        <p><strong>… by supporting spontaneous community care systems that produce and distribute healthy meals at scale, we can build capacity for a possibile future food crisis.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> After the medical crisis subsides, we will still be living within a broad economic collapse, unemployment crisis, and likely a general poverty crisis. This may lead to widespread food insecurity. We have already seen large increases in the number of customers at Madison’s food pantries. As a community, we should support the need that is here now, and prepare now for the eventuality of widespread food insecurity.</p>
        <p><strong>How:</strong> By paying local food-business fairly to do what they do best, we can both allay some of the unemployment and small-business closures, AND provide meals to our neighbors needing a little extra care or those experiencing chronic food insecurity. By building and tuning our systems now we will be practiced to meet this potential need in the near future.</p>

        <h1 id="who" class="title">Who We Are</h1>
        <p>We are a group of concerned citizens with expertise in a number of relevant fields such as: food service, public health,
        project development and tech. We came together when we saw the emergence of loosely connected initiatives to address the
        complementary needs of food systems and caregivers in the wake of the pandemic. <strong>Our starting point is to bring some
        connection to the great work already happening</strong>.</p>

        <hr>

        <h1 id="next" class="title">What Comes Next?</h1>
        <p>First we want to support and amplify existing community care initiatives. Then, we will observe patterns, spontaneous systems, and help identify opportunities to share resources, and contribute more directly and probably directly support some new meal initiatives.</p>
