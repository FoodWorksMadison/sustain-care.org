        <h4>How to Donate:</h4>
        <p>These big buttons will take you to PayPal, where you can choose an amount and whether you want your donation to be recurring.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>You can always donate directly by <a href="/list/" title="See all initiatives...">choosing a project</a> that resononates with you.</strong>
            But if you can't choose, or would like us to choose for you, you can give a <em>one time donation</em> or better yet, <em>a recurring donation</em> with
            the buttons here.
        </p>
        <p>If you donate here, <strong>100% of your donation will go to the projects/workers</strong> (less paypal fees). We will fairly direct the funds to the projects
        with the most effectiveness who address the most acute need at the time.</p>
        <h4>How Much?</h4>
        <p><strong>Don't know how much is appropriate?</strong> If you can, consider generously donating what you'd normally spend going
            out to eat during the week. Or, maybe what you might tip during the week. Or whatever you can. We know that things are tight all around now.
            <strong><a href="/contact/" title="contact us...">Get in touch</a> if you want to give a large amount and are worried about the fees.</strong></p>
