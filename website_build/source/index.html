        <p>We want to support our local food economy — our farmers, producers, distributors, restaurateurs, cooks and
        other food-service workers. We also aim to make sure that everyone has both safe working
        conditions with all currently advised public health protocols and is paid a fair wage for their work.
        </p>

        <p><strong>This website is brand new and has a lot of features missing, but we wanted to get the support flowing ASAP.</strong>
        </p>

            of community care initiatives, choose one that resonates with you, and give
