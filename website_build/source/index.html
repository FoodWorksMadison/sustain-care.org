        <h2 class="subtitle is-4">A community response to the COVID-19 crisis.</h2>

        <p><strong>Sustain Care aims to collect all known community care initiatives in and around Madison that put
        healthy prepared meals in the hands of essential workers, caregivers and their
        families, or any others experiencing food insecurity.</strong></p>
        <p>We want to support our local food economy — our farmers, producers, distributors, restaurateurs, cooks and
        other food-service workers. We also aim to make sure that everyone has both safe working
        conditions with all currently advised public health protocols and is paid a fair wage for their work.
        </p>

            of community care initiatives, choose one that resonates with you, and give
