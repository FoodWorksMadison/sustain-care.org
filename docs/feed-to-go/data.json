We deliver prepared meals to vulnerable residents while helping our entrepreneurs of color stay in business and creating culturally relevant foods for home-bound individuals.  We work with volunteers to pick up the meals at FEED each day by 3 pm to take to each site. We have a text broadcasting service that sends daily text updates to let interested residents know when and where meals will be delivered. FEED To Go simultaneously addresses food insecurity, access to culturally relevant foods, and business support for entrepreneurs of color and their employees.  We are feeding people and keeping people employed.\n","representative_name":"Abha Thakkar","main_url":"https://feedkitchens.org/feedtogo/","fundraising_url":"https://northsideplanningcouncil.org/donate/","fundraising_email":"director@northsideplanningcouncil.org","social_urls":[""],"institutions":[{"name":"Northside Planning Council","role":"It is the owner","url":"http://northsideplanningcouncil.org","logo":{"mimeType":"image/png","originalFilename":"NPC_circular text_200px - Abha Thakkar.png","fileExtension":"png","size":"34272","imageMediaMetadata":{"width":200,"height":203,"rotation":0,"time":"2018:02:19 17:39:31"},"original_url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TipSSrQKoF7bJ6K8MkXee5Zw3_ufQ_Na","filename":"logo.institution1.png"}}],"tags":["prepared-meals","delivery","distribution","commercial-kitchens"],"logos":[{"mimeType":"image/png","originalFilename":"FEEDtoGo_logo_3_20 - Abha Thakkar.png","fileExtension":"png","size":"58521","imageMediaMetadata":{"width":900,"height":900,"rotation":0},"original_url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=16W8B0Tbpmz5KtZCdFgE8X48lvfb7dCNE","filename":"logo1.png"}],"representative_images":[]}
